# Basic-Image-Classification
Using TensorFlow for Basic Image Classification

I have used TensorFlow for basic classification of images. The dataset was the mnist image dataset available in keras.
The dataset did not need much work to be done, as there was no imputation required.
One hot encoding was done for categorical columns.
In terms of preprocessing, reshaping and normalization was done.
Then the model was made and trained.
Accuracy was checked in the end
